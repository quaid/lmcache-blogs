"""Route content-board cards from issue labels.

Decides which column an issue belongs in, adds it to the project board, and sets
its status. Two modes:

``route``
    Handle one issue, named by number. Used by the ``issues`` event trigger.
``sweep``
    Walk every open issue in the repository and route any that is missing from
    the board or sitting with no status. This is the safety net: it catches
    issues created while the workflow was failing, issues that predate the
    workflow, and anything the event trigger missed.

The routing decision itself is :func:`route`, a pure function with no I/O, so it
can be tested exhaustively. Its defining property is **totality**: every
combination of labels produces a decision, and no input is silently ignored. An
issue the router cannot place is labelled ``needs-triage`` and commented on
rather than dropped.

Board writes need a token with ``project`` scope. ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` cannot write
to a user-owned Projects V2 board, so the workflow passes a separate secret; see
``docs/pipeline/board-routing.md``.
